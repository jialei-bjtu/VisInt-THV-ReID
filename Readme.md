VisInt-THV-ReID
We collect and release a large-scale tunnel hazmat vehicle Re-ID dataset named VisInt-THV-ReID (The dataset is open-sourced at: https://github.com/jialei-bjtu/VisInt-THV-ReID.git, 4 May 2022). To ensure the usability and reliability of the collected data, we deployed 4 monitoring cameras for research in Taijia Expressway Linxian No.3 tunnel in Shanxi province in China. The monitoring cameras provide high-definition video data of 6 million pixels, and the installation spacing is 300 meters. We collected the video of three days from November 26 to 28, 2021, and recorded the video data of 30 hours from 10 : 00 to 20 : 00 every day. We annotated 10048 pictures taken by 865 hazmat vehicles in 4 cameras, and annotated the spatial position, speed and time stamp information of vehicles in the tunnel. We release a large-scale tunnel hazmat vehicle Re-ID dataset named VisInt-THV-ReID. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-sourced hazmat vehicle Re-ID dataset. 

Take 0435_c02_26_20_51_27_56.4_7.87_132.3.jpg file name for example：0435 is the vehicle ID, c02 is the camera ID, 26 is November 26, 2020, 20_51_27 is 20:51:27, the 56.4 is the vehicle speed, 7.87_132.3 are the coordinates in the tunnel x=7.87, y=132.3.
The sample dataset is shown in Fig.1
